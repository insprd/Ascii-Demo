Threejs Testbench with ASCII Effect

## Getting Started

Add a glTF model to `public/models/api` directory. There are many available on Sketchfab.

Update the path to your model in `components/scene.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

If you run into problems, you can test your model in a vanilla setting using `preview.tsx`.
